  <h1>T'NITE Alumni Association (TAA)</h1>
  <p>This is a single page static website.</p>
  <p>The T'NITE Alumni Association (TAA) aims to foster a spirit of loyalty and promote Institution's general welfare.</p>
  <p>In addition, TAA exists to support the institutional goals and strengthens the ties between the alumni, the community, and the Institution.  T'NITE Alumni Association, was established in 1979, initially took on the leadership role with the enthusiasm and willingness of several individuals who were willing to take the initiative for the betterment of the Institution they had been associated with. And the primary interest of a good nucleus of alumni is to encourage the students through various motivational activities for sound sustenance. </p>
  <p>MILESTONE The milestone for the leader of a TAA is laid on the followings foundation:  Willingness to work with the TNSS School  Desire to contribute time and funds for necessary development activities  To motivate and engage alumni in good works Hence, it is essential to have core group leaders to take upon the Development and Alumni Relations Building Programmes to help the TNSS School alumnus pursue their careers in appropriate directions.  PURPOSED VISION OF TAA  Alumni who wish to be a member have direct access to the Association through this automated webpage. We are reluctantly working on automatically generating membership cards after paying the minimum required amount of ₹500 through a link and payment gateway.   It will imbue the mass registration drive of members to work on fundamental principles and aims.   It will help contribute to TAA's laid objectives, and they will be expected to lend the time & resources for its success & productivity.  Value the TAA's noble efforts and work for the basic message in which the Association is formed.   Any alliance is based on real-time access for the inclusion of maximum participants. In this direction, to sustain as an association, our primary focus is towards implementing the plan for the year and a dedicated column, "सम्झना र स्मृति", has been programmed where members can share & write their experiences freely.  PLANNER FOR THE YEAR 2023: To achieve Association fundamental aim the propose activities are:  1. Creating a gallery within the school premises.  2. Events to facilitate the entire school administration for their contribution and dedicated work. Other amusement activities also tentatively planned for the TNSS Students.   3. TAA will publish its own Annual Newsletter for the year 2023.  WE DEEM TO DELIVER: A Stable executive member, a set of activities, a newsletter, and counseling programs for every successive year. Indeed, we plan to operate effectively with your support and an excellent system.   However, alumni concentrations and strengths in these areas are relatively small and nominally led by few at present. Still, we have a profound belief in our pass-outs, who will surely come forward and lend us their support to meet the primary goals in future. Or they can also serve simply as a Contact Point through our Website for prospective students who wish to participate and to hear from someone's personal experience. Therefore, the role of a person has been designated as a key point of contact to identify people willing to help & work with us conveniently. They will also be in regular communication and responsible for circulating the details of events and other significant news.  Presently, TAA is formally structured and wishes to gather socially from time to time.  </p>
